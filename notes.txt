Select default application for xdg-open by mime type:
$ xdg-mime default atril.desktop application/pdf

Installing applications not trivial because currently puppet apply is being
run as user
-> add way to create two puppet files from 1 template; run apps.pp as root?

Figure out if we can rewrite i3config generation to only run when necessary:
-> Maybe rewrite unconditional execs into two-step execs which use generated
   as puppet source files to make gen check easier

Rewrite per-host gitconfig using compile script
